# Topic 26: Multi Head Attention

> Goal: Implement head split/combine mechanics and per-head attention in vectorized form.
> Time: 2-3 hours | Difficulty: Medium

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you will:
1. Implement core primitives for Multi Head Attention in pure NumPy.
2. Enforce strict tensor shape contracts and deterministic checks.
3. Diagnose and fix at least one high-risk failure mode before optimization.
4. Explain trade-offs between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 implementations.

---

## Why This Topic Matters

This topic is a dependency for later modules. If this implementation is unstable, downstream topics inherit silent bugs.
Focus area for this topic: head axis transforms and mask broadcast to (B,H,T,T).

---

## Problem Statement

Build a complete, testable implementation path for Multi Head Attention across solution tiers:
- Level 1: correctness-first baseline
- Level 2: vectorized acceleration
- Level 3: memory/performance-aware variant
- Level 4: reference verification only

Primary API focus for this topic:
- split_heads, combine_heads, multi_head_attention, multi_head_attention_vectorized

---

## Constraints

- Use NumPy and Python stdlib only for implementation.
- Preserve numerical stability for stress-test tensor sizes.
- Keep behavior consistent across Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 within tolerance.
- Do not treat Level 4 as the implementation shortcut.

---

## High-Risk Failure Mode

- Incorrect transpose in combine_heads returns permuted token order with same final shape.

Mitigation strategy:
1. Lock shape contracts before optimization.
2. Add a deterministic seed-based regression case.
3. Compare Level 2 and Level 3 outputs against Level 1 on the same input.

---

## Shape Contract Example

- Input (2,6,16), heads=4 -> split (2,4,6,4) -> combine back (2,6,16).

This contract should be explicitly asserted during development and in tests.

---

## Verification Workflow

1. Run basic correctness tests:
   'python3 -m pytest tests/test_basic.py -v'
2. Run boundary-condition tests:
   'python3 -m pytest tests/test_edge.py -v'
3. Run performance/stability tests:
   'python3 -m pytest tests/test_stress.py -v'
4. Validate full topic through the runner:
   'python3 utils/test_runner.py --day 26'

---

## Success Criteria

1. All topic tests pass with finite outputs.
2. Deterministic checks reproduce the same outputs under fixed seed.
3. Documented failure mode is reproducibly prevented by assertions/tests.
4. Level 2 or Level 3 shows concrete implementation improvement over Level 1.

## Deliverables

- Updated implementation in solutions/
- Passing tests in tests/test_basic.py, tests/test_edge.py, tests/test_stress.py
- Notes in questions.md and progressive troubleshooting via hints/
