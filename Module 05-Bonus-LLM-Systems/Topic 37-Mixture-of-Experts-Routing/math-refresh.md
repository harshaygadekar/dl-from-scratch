# Math Refresh: Mixture of Experts Routing

## Core Expression

Start from a clear baseline formula and define each tensor axis explicitly.

## Stability Reminder

Apply clipping or normalization where scores/logits can grow unbounded.

## Verification Rule

When adding an optimization, compare against baseline with max absolute error and relative error thresholds.
