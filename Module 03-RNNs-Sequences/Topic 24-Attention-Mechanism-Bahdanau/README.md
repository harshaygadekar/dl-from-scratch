# Topic 24: Attention Mechanism (Bahdanau)

> Goal: build a working NumPy scaffold for Attention Mechanism (Bahdanau).

## Scope
- Implement core forward primitives first.
- Add at least one backward/gradient-related check where relevant.
- Verify shape contracts with tests.

## Files
- `questions.md`
- `intuition.md`
- `math-refresh.md`
- `hints/`
- `solutions/` (level 1-4)
- `tests/` (basic/edge/stress)

## Success Criteria
1. `test_basic.py` passes.
2. `test_edge.py` covers at least one tricky boundary case.
3. `test_stress.py` runs larger tensors without crashing.
