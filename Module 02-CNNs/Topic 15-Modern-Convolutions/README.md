# Topic 15: Modern Convolutions

> Goal: build a working NumPy scaffold for modern convolutions.

## Scope
- Implement core functions in `solutions/`.
- Validate shapes and core numerical behavior in `tests/`.
- Use hints if blocked, then return to your own implementation.

## Files
- `questions.md`: implementation tasks
- `intuition.md`: conceptual why
- `math-refresh.md`: formulas and shape rules
- `hints/`: three progressive hints
- `solutions/`: level 1-4 implementations
- `tests/`: basic/edge/stress checks

## Success Criteria
1. `test_basic.py` passes for level 1/2 implementations.
2. Key edge conditions in `test_edge.py` are covered.
3. `level04_pytorch_reference.py` can be used as optional verification.
